<h1>Welcome to Saud Beach!</h1>
<p style="font-family: maitree; font-size: 20px; color: azure;" ><span style="font-size: 25px;">SAUD BEACH-THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BEACH IN ASIAS.</span> Saud Beach is the most beautiful and attractive beach in the province of Ilocos Norte. It has a two-kilometer length composed of soft white sand, coconut palms, and crystal-clear turquoise water at the northern tip of Luzon. It is an 11 to 12 hours drive from Metro Manila but it’s all worth coming here. Saud Beach offers tourists a relaxing vacation and a serene environment perfect for nature lovers.</p>
<P style="font-family: maitree; font-size: 20px; color: azure;">According to its history, Saud Beach was listed as one of the 25 most beautiful beaches in the world by Travel + Leisure which is a popular travel magazine based in New York USA. It is the only beach in the Philippines to make it to the list and it is one of the only three Southeast Asian beaches included in the list. The other two are the clean and peaceful beach of Bai Dam Trau in Vietnam and the well-known Railay Beach in Thailand. For this reason, the Department of Tourism (DOT) agency is delighted with the prestigious award and vows to support more tourism projects in the region.</P>
<p style="font-family: maitree; font-size: 20px; color: azure;">Subsequently, Saud Beach was proclaimed as Asia’s leading beach destination at the 27th World Travel Awards in the year 2022 because of its pristine waters and magnificent shoreline. It is often tagged as the Boracay of the North for its fine powdery white sand beaches. Presently, Saud Beach is visited by thousands of tourists every year and it is a perfect getaway for family and friends who want to relax and simply enjoy the tranquil atmosphere. So if you like to swim in the pleasant wave, see the unspoiled white sand pitches, and have breakfast and lunch under a thatch-roof cabana under the palms then visit Saud Beach as soon as possible.</p>
