<h1>Welcome to Bangui Wind Farm!</h1>
<p style="font-family: maitree; font-size: 20px; color: azure;" ><span style="font-size: 25px;">Operated by the NorthWind Power Development Corporation, Bangui Wind Farm was born out of a study done in 1996. 22 years later, the windmill farm is still standing strong, providing 50% or 33 megawatts of Ilocos Norte’s electricity.

  It was Southeast Asia’s largest wind farm until its next-door neighbor, the Burgos Wind Farm, took the title in 2014. Even with the title stripped, it still draws more tourists than the Burgos Wind Farm because of its accessibility.
  
  Each windmill turbine has three vertical rotor blades standing 70 meters high above the shore. There are a total of 20 turbines arranged on a single row along the shoreline of the Bangui Bay just in front of the West Philippine Sea. Its location is an ideal area for wind turbines installation since it is near the Asia-Pacific monsoon where North Westerly winds are constant.

  Not only are these wind turbines a sustainable environmental innovation, but it has also become a top tourist attraction in the province. It may also remind you of Denmark’s scenic windmill parks. Thousands of tourists visit Bangui Windmill Farm, especially during summer season. Good thing is that there are no fees to pay to get a stunning photo underneath one of the towering windmills. Make sure to visit the windmill farm during daylight to get a glimpse of the beautiful windmill attraction.</p>
